This project demonstrates my ability to design and deploy a complete Security Operations Center (SOC) monitoring environment using open-source tools. The lab simulates real-world enterprise logging, detection, alerting, and incident response workflows.

I configured a Wazuh SIEM server and deployed a Kali Linux endpoint running Wazuh Agent, Suricata IDS, and Filebeat. Detection pipelines were validated using simulated attacks such as Nmap scanning, brute-force authentication attempts, and file integrity modifications.

This project showcases technical skills required for SOC Analyst Level 1 and 2 roles, including SIEM architecture, log ingestion, IDS tuning, Linux administration, and incident reporting.

            Learning Outcomes

By completing this lab I gained hands-on experience in:

Deploying and configuring Wazuh SIEM

Installing and tuning Suricata Intrusion Detection System

Configuring Filebeat to ship security logs to the SIEM

Understanding log pipelines, ingestion, parsing, and alert generation

Running offensive security tools (Nmap, Hydra, SSH brute-force)

Validating alerts inside a SOC dashboard

Writing professional SOC incident reports

Creating a complete detection engineering project for a portfolio
